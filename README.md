Project Description:
Clearwater State University offers various degree programs, from online degrees to a doctorate in education. Programs are offered in the streams of the arts, education, business & nursing.
Some key strategic goals of the University are:
• Increase enrolment of students
• Improve retention, progression, and graduation rates
• Recruit better academically qualified undergraduate and graduate students
• Increase external funding and recognition

Business Questions:
Leverage data on student demographic profile, course preferences, performance record, grades, financial background, financial aid and other application information to:

Identify key drivers of early student attrition
Build a predictive model to identify students with higher early attrition risk
Recommend appropriate interventions based on the analysis
Deliverables:
Besides submitting the well documented code, it is expected that main takeaways and insights gained through the analysis will be presented in the form of a PowerPoint report. This report should outline and summarize the
following:
• Exploratory Data Analysis showing key associations
• Segment Analysis showing key drivers of attrition
• Results of statistical model along with business interpretations and recommended interventions

Data:
Primarily, data will be of the following high level categories:
a. Student Application data (demographics, High school GPA)
b. Financial Indicators (financial background, eligibility, quantum of aid)
c. Course Preferences
d. Performance Record

Miscellaneous Notes::
a) Define key dependent variables (Y), independent variables (Xs), operating definition of how they will be calculated, appropriate cut-off points and indicators
b) Baseline performance over last few years - % early attrition across different courses. This will provide an existing benchmark, with focus on identifying ways to improve this through the project
c) Next, we suggest you work through understanding the data, dictionary and contents. We also recommend performance of outlier and sanity checks on data to identify attributes that are more robust and more suited for analysis.
d) The next step should Be exploring the data and then using the suitable model to reach the desired outcome.
